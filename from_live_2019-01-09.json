United Kingdom has the right to unilateral revocation of the notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU, until such time as the Withdrawal Agreement is formally concluded; therefore calls on the UK Government to request an extension to the period of negotiation under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union so that the UK does not leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement or on the basis of the negotiated agreement laid before the House on Monday 26 November 2018; and calls on the UK Government to respect the will of the Scottish Parliament in its vote on 5 December 2018 and the Welsh Assembly in its vote on 4 December 2018, which both rejected the withdrawal agreement as it now stands.\"","Sponsors":[{"MemberId":4390,"SortOrder":0,"HasRelevantInterest":false,"Name":"Ian
